# elpa
R package for analyzing ELPA21 Data with R.

This package is a work-in-progress based on the ELPA data analysis done for Springdale Public Schools.

This package should be able to generate charts for any school/district/state's test results from the ELPA21 portal.

It's not really up to CRAN submission quality, though a couple of the helper functions are potentially generically usable!

One goal of the project is to use *only* information from the ELPA portal -- with no additional data sources.  This limits some of the investigations that would otherwise be possible.

The package includes de-identified ELPA scores from the Springdale Public School District in Arkansas from 2020, 2021 and 2022.
